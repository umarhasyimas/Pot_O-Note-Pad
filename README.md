# Pot-O Note Pad

**Pot-O Note Pad** is a desktop text and code editor built for Windows. It is developed using Python, PyQt5, and QScintilla, offering a feature set that bridges the gap between a basic Notepad and a lightweight IDE. 

This editor supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages, advanced find-and-replace, formatting tools, printing, PDF export, drag-and-drop file support, and more—all within a familiar, Windows-native interface.
